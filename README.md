# Lauren Eaton - Portfolio

## Description 

This repository ("Lauren Eaton - Portfolio") aims to display in a concise, yet stylish manner, all existing and future work (using placeholders) associated with myself. As a portfolio, it was necessary to make both the design and content cohesive and yet straightfoward, showing who I am as a student front-end web developer, some personal information and contact information/social media links. Placeholders have been implemented on the empty sections so that further down the line, as the portfolio develops and grows, content can be easily added with necessary links.

## Usage 

This portfolio should display all existing and future content cohesively on both desktop and smaller displays, adjusting the content so that it is easily accessible. Users are able to navigate to different sections of the page using the navigation bar, as well as complimentary links to my GitHub account and a link to my CV on Google Drive.

The projects section contains a grid detailing all existing projects as well as placeholders, all with suitable images that, when interacted with, directs the user to the necessary page.

In addition to this, the Contacts section contains not only links to my personal instagram and LinkedIn profile, it contains a gmail icon that, when pressed, will automatically direct the user to their default application to initiate an e-mail.
